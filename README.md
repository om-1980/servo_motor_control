Four-switch motor control, also known as four-quadrant motor control, is a method used to control the direction and speed of a motor. It involves the use of four switches connected to the motor windings, allowing current to flow in both directions. By selectively turning the switches on and off, the motor can be made to rotate in either direction and at different speeds. This control scheme is commonly used in various applications, including server motors, where precise control over motor speed and direction is required.
